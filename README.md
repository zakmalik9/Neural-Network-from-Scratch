# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

My Semester Project for Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming Course. I made a Neural Network from Scratch in C++. The model was trained and tested on Doodles from Google QuickDraw Dataset.

## Full Procedure

1.	**Training Dataset**: The training dataset was downloaded from the GitHub Repository of Google Quick Draw. Data was in form of .npy files.
2.	**Python Code**: To convert the data into a form usable by C++, Python Code was written to convert data from .npy files into .txt files.
3.	 **Neural Network Code**: Code was divided and 5 header files containing 5 classes were created. These consisted of Node Class, Layer Class, Image Data Class, Neural Network Class, and finally Network Controller Class which is used by the user through GUI.
4.	**Graphical User Interface**: Simple GUI was created with 3 main functions: To Train the network with given parameters; Display Test Image with Label and the Prediction by the Network; Draw custom Image and Display real time Predictions from Network. GUI made using Windows Form.
